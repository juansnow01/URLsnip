Python script that shortens URL's

### New Repo

I'm really having a better time learning by building instead of just learning by reading/videos. This time I drummed up a script that condenses long URLs. 

As time goes on and I learn more HTML/CSS/JS and Python at a higher level I'll be adding front ends to all of these projects. 

Enjoy!
